## 🛠 System Overview
This repository contains a specialized encryption designed for **one specific person**. It utilizes a sophisticated "Runaway Button" algorithm and a secure login gateway to ensure only the recipient can access the final payload.

## 📁 Repository Contents
* `index.html`: The structural foundation of my feelings.
* `v.css`: The styling (because you make everything look better).
* `v.js`: The logic (which I lose whenever I'm around you).
* `valentine.gif`: A visual representation of us.

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions
1.  **Unlock:** Use the secret key (Our favorite word).
2.  **Interact:** Try to click 'No' (System Error: Option not found).
3.  **Celebrate:** View the final memory gallery.
